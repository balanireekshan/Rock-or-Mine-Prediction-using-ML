# Sonar Rock or Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project focuses on predicting whether objects detected by sonar signals are rocks or mines using machine learning classification techniques. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the classic "Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks" dataset.

## Dataset Description

- **Dataset Name:** Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks
- **Source:** The dataset was collected from sonar signals bouncing off a metal cylinder (mine) and a roughly cylindrical rock under various conditions.
- **Attributes:** 60 real-valued attributes representing the strength of sonar returns at different angles, normalized to a range between 0 and 1.
- **Class Label:** Each instance is labeled as "R" (rock) or "M" (mine).
- **Instances:** 208 instances in total.
- - **Dataset:** [Download the Sonar Rock or Mine dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-fKCXJnDif8HTE7nKXJ5Se7_V2xQDKAS/view?usp=sharing)

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to train machine learning models to classify sonar returns accurately. Techniques like logistic regression are applied to build a predictive system for identifying underwater objects with high precision.

## Usage

1. **Dataset:** Download the dataset from the provided link or use your own.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, scale features, and encode class labels if necessary.
3. **Model Training:** Train machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression) using preprocessed data.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Prediction:** Use trained models to predict if a sonar return pattern corresponds to a rock or a mine.

## Conclusion

This project provides a practical approach to binary classification using real-world sonar data. By leveraging the "Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks" dataset and machine learning techniques, it enables researchers and practitioners to develop robust models for underwater object detection. The project, available on GitHub, encourages collaboration and exploration of classification algorithms and signal processing techniques.
